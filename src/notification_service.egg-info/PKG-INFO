# Notification Service

## Overview

A FastAPI-based web application that integrates a **Google Pub/Sub subscriber** for processing and reacting to published messages in real time.  
This service listens to a specified Pub/Sub subscription, handles message acknowledgment, and sends an email using the Google API. 

The purpose of the **Notification Service** is to act as a **standalone microservice** that integrates with other systems or microservices to send out emails triggered by Pub/Sub events.

Dishka is used to manage dependency injection and we structure the project to aid domain driven design. 

## Architecture
**Direction of Dependencies (DDD)**

This project follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to maintain a clean and modular architecture.

**Dependency Rule**

All dependencies flow inward, toward the Domain layer, which represents the core business logic of the system.

`Infrastructure  →  Application  →  Domain`


The Domain is at the core (or bottom, depending on visualization).
It contains all business rules and has no knowledge of external systems.

**Layer Responsibilities**

`Domain` — Core business rules, entities, value objects, and domain services.
No external dependencies.

`Application` — Orchestrates use cases and defines ports (interfaces) for external services.
Depends only on the Domain.

`Infrastructure` — Implements the ports defined in the Application layer (e.g., SMTP, Pub/Sub, DB).
Depends on Application and Domain.

`Presentation` — Handles input/output (HTTP, CLI, etc.) and calls into the Application layer.

## Running Tests with Docker

To run the test suite inside a Docker environment:

1. Navigate to the **test configuration directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ./config/test

   docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yaml up --build
   ```

## TODO

1. **Make consumer idempotent**

### Idempotency Goal

In the current setup, multiple instances of the **Notification Service** can be connected to the same **Google Pub/Sub subscription**.  
The goal is to ensure that **only one consumer processes a given message**, even if multiple consumers receive or acknowledge it concurrently.

This form of idempotency means:

- Each Pub/Sub message should be **acted upon exactly once**, regardless of how many service instances are running.
- If a message is redelivered or received by multiple subscribers, **only the first successful handler** should perform the side effect (e.g., sending an email).
- Other consumers that receive the same message should detect that it has already been processed and safely **acknowledge and skip it**.

### Possible Approaches

- Use a **message deduplication store** (e.g., Redis, Postgres) to track processed message IDs.  
  Before handling a message, check if its `message_id` or `event_id` has already been recorded.
- Implement an **idempotency key** derived from the event payload or Pub/Sub `message_id`.
- Store and enforce processing status at the **application level**, ensuring that replays or retries do not trigger duplicate actions.

**Goal:**  
Ensure **at-least-once delivery semantics** from Pub/Sub do not result in **duplicate side effects** in the Notification Service.
